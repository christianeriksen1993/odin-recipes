<h3>Description</h3>
<p>A traditional recipe for this classic mediterranian dish.</p>
<p>This hummus can be prepared in advance and 
    is perfect on toast, as a dip for vegetables 
    or as a flavourful side dish.</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>3 cups cooked chickpeas</li>
    <li>1 to 2 garlic cloves, minced</li>
    <li>3 to 4 ice cubes</li>
    <li>1/3 cup  (79 grams) tahini paste</li>
    <li>1/2 tsp kosher salt</li>
    <li>Juice of 1 lemon</li>
    <li>Hot water (if needed)</li>
    <li>Extra virgin olive oil</li>
    <li>Sumac</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Add chickpeas and minced garlic to the bowl of a food processor. 
        Puree until a smooth, powder-like mixture forms.</li>
    <li>While processor is running, add ice cubes, tahini, 
        salt, and lemon juice. Blend for about 4 minutes or
         so. Check, and if the consistency is too thick 
         still, run processor and slowly add a little hot 
         water. Blend until you reach desired silky smooth 
         consistency.</li>
    <li>Spread in a serving bowl and add a generous 
        drizzle of Early Harvest EVOO. Add a few chickpeas 
        to the middle, if you like. Sprinkle sumac on top. 
        Enjoy with warm pita wedges and your favorite 
        veggies.</li>
