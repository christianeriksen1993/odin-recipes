<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt, or to taste</li>
    <li>1 cup milk</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
    <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt 
        in a large bowl.</li>
    <li>Make a well in the center, 
        and pour in milk, oil, and egg. Mix until smooth.</li>
    <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over 
        medium-high heat. Pour or scoop batter onto the 
        griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each 
        pancake; cook until bubbles form and the edges 
        are dry, 1 to 2 minutes. Flip and cook until 
        browned on the other side. Repeat with remaining 
        batter.</li>
